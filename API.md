This is the up-to-date list of `MiniBot` custom API, classified into 3 categories according to their lifecycles:

1. Common<br />
The functions that always exist in both GLUE and World.
2. In-World<br />
The functions that only exist in-world.
3. GLUE<br />
The functions that only exist in GLUE screens.

All of the custom API below are registered in a specific global table `wmbapi` if the client is not OEM. Otherwise, the table name becomes `[MACRO]api`, such as "abcapi" if your OEM short name is "abc". Remember to refer back to this from time to time as the API may change in future.

Before diving into the list, last but not least, we **DO NOT** provide intensive support for the API set. Questions such as "hey, what does API XXX mean?" will be ignored. Please help yourself if you decide to utilize them for your own good.

## Common (Arguments)

- `path = GetAppStorageDirectory()`

Gets the base directory path of app storage.

- `path = GetAppDirectory()`

Gets the app base directory path.

- `username = GetAppUsername()`

Gets the app username.

- `count = GetAppSessionCount()`

Gets the total session count of the current launch.

- `index = GetAppSessionIndex()`

Gets the index of the current launched session, starting from 1.

- `token = GetAppSessionToken()`

Gets the unique token of the current launched session. This is a randomly generated unique string.

- `path = GetWoWDirectory()`

Gets the WoW base directory path.

- `value = GetSystemVar(name)`

Gets the value of the system variable previously set by `SetSystemVar`. **nil** if it does not exist.

- `value = SetSystemVar(name, value)`

Sets a system variable.

The standard Lua environment gets reset after screen switch including **/reload**. All Lua variables get lost because of this. In this way, we provide "System Variables" that allow you to persist information across different screens in the current game session. This is similar as the game "Console Variable", consisting of a name-value pair.

```lua
-- name (string): The name of the system variable.
-- value (string): The value of the system variable.
```

## Common (Constants)

- `encodings = GetStringEncodingsTable()`

Gets the table of supported string encodings.

```lua
encodings = {
  Base64 = 1,
  Hex = 2
}
```

Notice that "Hex" encoded strings are always generated in lower case, in order to match the global convention.

- `types = GetValueTypesTable()`

Gets the table that contains all value types to read from memory, which looks like:

```lua
types = {
  Bool = 1,
  Char = 2,
  Byte = 3,
  Short = 4,
  UShort = 5,
  Int = 6,
  UInt = 7,
  Long = 8,
  ULong = 9,
  Float = 10,
  Double = 11,
  String = 12,
  IntPtr = 13,
  UIntPtr = 14,
  GUID = 15,
}
```

## Common (Encryption)

In order to make sure your own SHA256 digest matches the API above, the test vector is given below:

```lua
local test = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
local encodings = GetStringEncodingsTable();
local digest = Sha256(test, encodings.Hex);
print("result:", digest);

-- output (string): The plain string. nil if decryption fails.
```

In order to make sure your own AES encryption matches the API above, the test vector is given below:

```lua
local test = "test";

-- content (string): The file content.
```

- `success = WriteFile(path, content[, append[, encoding]])`

Writes certain content to a file. If you specify encoding, binary content is written (append is not supported in this case). Otherwise, UTF-8 text is written.

```lua
-- path (string): The file path.
-- content (string): The file content.
-- append (boolean): Whether to append the text content or overwrite the file.
-- encoding (number): The encoding of the file binary content, from GetStringEncodingsTable(). nil for text write.

[Back to Top](#custom-api)

## Common (Network)

- `request = SendHttpRequest(info)`

Sends a HTTP request asynchronously. The API will return immediately after the request is sent without waiting for the response.

```lua
-- The request info.
info = {
  -- string: The request URL.
  Url = "https://www.microsoft.com/",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The request method, can be "GET", "POST", "PUT" or "DELETE".
  Method = "POST",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The additional request headers.
  Headers = "Content-Type: application/json\r\nX-Custom: test",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The request body, only used Method is "POST" or "PUT".
  Body = "{\"test\": 123}",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The pinned HTTPs server certificate as a protection for packet sniffing. If provided, the server certificate must match it or the HTTP request would fail with status "INVALID_CERTIFICATE".
  Certificate = "PINNED CERTIFICATE",
  -- [OPTIONAL] function: The callback function when the status of the request is updated.
  Callback = function(request, status) ... end,
}
-- The HTTP request ID if sent successfully, for querying HTTP response later.
request = "abc123"
```

- `status[, response] = ReceiveHttpResponse(request)`

Checks the status and receives the response of an existing HTTP request. The request will be cleared from memory after the API call if the request is done successfully or unsuccessfully.

```lua
-- The HTTP request ID previously sent.
request = "abc123"
-- The current status of the HTTP request, can be:
-- "REQUESTING": The request is still on the way.
-- "REQUEST_FAILED": The request is terminated due to failures.
-- "INVALID_CERTIFICATE": The request is terminated due to invalid HTTPs certificate.
-- "RESPONDING": Downloading response after the request is sent.
-- "RESPONSE_HEADERS_FAILED": The response download is terminated while fetching response headers.
-- "RESPONSE_BODY_FAILED": The response download is terminated while fetching response body.
-- "SUCCESS": The response is received and everything about the HTTP request is done.
status = "CONNECTING"
-- The response data, available if status is "SUCCESS"
response = {
  -- number: The HTTP response status code.
  Code = 200,
  -- string: The HTTP response headers.
  Headers = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK...",
  -- string: The HTTP response body.
  Body = "...",
  -- string: The actual server certificate if the request is HTTPs, which can be used for pinning.
  Certificate = "SERVER CERTIFICATE",
}
```

Given the nature of async programming model, a simple example to send and receive HTTP is given as below, leveraging the callback function.

```lua
wmbapi.SendHttpRequest({
  Url = "https://www.microsoft.com",
  ...
  Callback = function(request, status)
    -- Deal with the current status and response of the HTTP request here.
    if (status == "SUCCESS") then
      local _, response = wmbapi.ReceiveHttpResponse(request);
      print("response body:", response.Body);
    end
  end
});
```

Another example to send and receive HTTP is given as below, leveraging frame updates.

```lua
local http_frame = CreateFrame("FRAME");
local http_request;
http_frame:SetScript("OnUpdate", function()
  if (not http_request) then
    local info = {...}; -- Fill your actual info here.
    http_request = wmbapi.SendHttpRequest(info);
  else
    local http_status, http_response = wmbapi.ReceiveHttpResponse(http_request)
    if (not http_status) then
      -- The HTTP request has been fulfiled.
      http_frame:SetScript("OnUpdate", nil);
      http_frame = nil;
      return;
    end
    -- Deal with the current status and response of the HTTP request here.
    if (http_status == "SUCCESS") then
      print("response body:", http_response.Body);
    end
  end
end);
```

- `connection = ConnectWebsocket(info)`

Connects to a remote websocket server asynchronously. The API will return immediately after the connection is initiated.

```lua
-- The websocket info.
info = {
  -- string: The websocket URL. (Use http(s) instead of ws(s))
  Url = "https://echo.websocket.org",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The additional request headers.
  Headers = "Content-Type: application/json\r\nX-Custom: test",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The pinned HTTPs server certificate as a protection for packet sniffing. If provided, the server certificate must match it or the websocket connection would fail with status "INVALID_CERTIFICATE".
  Certificate = "PINNED CERTIFICATE",
  -- [OPTIONAL] function: The callback function when the status of the connection is updated, which can be any one of "CONNECTING", "CONNECTION_FAILED", "INVALID_CERTIFICATE", "CONNECTED", "CLOSING", "CLOSED".
  ConnectCallback = function(connection, status) ... end,
  -- [OPTIONAL] function: The callback function when a piece of data is sent over the connection. (Only string data is supported)
  SendCallback = function(connection, data) ... end,
  -- [OPTIONAL] function: The callback function when a piece of data is received over the connection. (Only string data is supported)
  ReceiveCallback = function(connection, data) ... end
}
-- The websocket connection ID if sent successfully.
connection = "abc123"
```

- `success = CloseWebsocket(connection)`

Closes an existing websocket connection.

- `success = SendWebsocketData(connection, data)`

Sends a piece of string data over an existing websocket connection.

Given the nature of async programming model, a simple example to establish a websocket connection, send data, and disconnect it after data is received is given as below.

```lua
wmbapi.ConnectWebsocket({
  Url = "https://echo.websocket.org",
  ...
  ConnectCallback = function(connection, status)
    -- Deal with the current connection status here.
    if (status == "CONNECTED") then
      print("connected!");
      wmbapi.SendWebsocketData(connection, "test data!");
    elseif (status == "CLOSED") then
      print("disconnected!");
    end
  end,
  SendCallback = function(connection, data)
    print("data sent:", data);
  end,
  ReceiveCallback = function(connection, data)
    print("data received:", data);
    wmbapi.CloseWebsocket(connection);
  end
});
```

## In-World (Action)

- `ClickPosition(x, y, z[, right])`

Clicks a world position.

- `FaceDirection(angle[, update])`

Faces a horizontal direction, in radian.

- `SetPitch(angle)`

Sets the player vertical pitch, in radian.

- `MoveTo(x, y, z[, instantTurn])`

[Back to Top](#custom-api)

## In-World (Aura)

- `count = GetAuraCount(unit, [spellId])`

Gets the count of auras on a specific unit, optionally filtered by spell ID. You must call this API first to actually search auras to be saved in memory. This API returns all auras including hidden ones, more than you can get normally by BLZ API [UnitAura](https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_UnitAura).

```lua
-- unit (string): The unit to check the auras.
-- spellId (number): The spell ID of the auras to filter. nil for all.
-- count (number): The actual aura count. nil if the unit does not exist.
```

- `spellId | ... = GetAuraWithIndex(index[, detailed = false])`

Gets the info of a specific aura, saved by the most recent call to `GetAuraCount()`. If "detailed" is true, the return values will be the same as the BLZ API [UnitAura](https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_UnitAura). If "detailed" is false, the return value will be only the aura spell ID with a bit better performance.

Due to technical difficulties, we only make partial results available in Classic version, which include `_, _, count, _, duration, expirationTime, source, _, _, spellId, ...` ONLY. But in Retail, all are just fine so don't worry.

```lua
-- index (number): The index of the aura.
-- detailed (boolean): Whether to get the details for the aura.
-- spellId (number): The spell ID of the aura.
```

A code example to show all auras of the current target is given below.

```lua
if (UnitExists("target")) then
  local aura_count = GetAuraCount("target");
  print(">>>>" .. UnitName("target") .. "<<<<");
  for i = 1, aura_count do
    print(GetAuraWithIndex(i, true));
  end
end
```

## In-World (Navigation)

- `mapId, zoneId = GetCurrentMapInfo()`

Gets the map information about the current location.

- `isOrNot = MapExists(mapId)`

Checks whether the navigation files for a specific map exists.

- `success = LoadMap(mapId)`

Loads a navigation map. Notice that map files must be placed correctly before loading.

- `success = UnloadMap(mapId)`

Unloads a navigation map.

- `isOrNot = IsMapLoaded(mapId)`

Checks if a navigation map is loaded.

- `path = FindPath(mapId, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2[, ignoreWater = true|ignoreFlags = 8(NAV_WATER), searchCapacity = 1024, agentRadius = 0])`

Calculates a path to navigate from one position to another. Notice that the mapId must be loaded beforehand for the calculation to work properly.

```lua
-- mapId (number): The map ID.
-- x1, y1, z1 (number): The start position.
-- x2, y2, z2 (number): The end position.
-- ignoreWater (boolean): Whether to avoid walking into water terrain.
-- ignoreFlags (number): Alternatively, if you pass a number in place of ignoreWater, you can specify navmesh polygon flags to be ignored. ignoreWater = true is equal to ignoreFlags = 8 which is NAV_WATER flags. This is useful if your map pack has different poly flags or if you wish to ignore arbitrary polygons.
-- searchCapacity (number): This is a combined value to specify the maximum count of waypoints and the size of search node pool. Increase the number if you wish to find longer path, but meanwhile it will also take longer time due to more navmesh polygons to traverse.
-- agentRadius (number): The radius of the navigation agent (your character), in yards. To avoid wall collision, you should set the value accordingly. This value can only take 5 in maximum, and any number > 5 will lead to ignorance.
```

- `resultX, resultY, resultZ, distance = GetClosestPositionOnMesh(mapId, x, y, z[, ignoreWater = true])`

Projects a specific position onto a navigation mesh map. Notice that if the position is too far away from any mesh polygons, the API will return nil.

```lua
-- mapId (number): The map ID.
-- x, y, z (number): The position to be projected.
-- ignoreWater (boolean): Whether water map areas are to be ignored/excluded.
-- resultX, resultY, resultZ (number): The result position projected on mesh. nil if the position is too far away.
-- distance (number): The distance between {x, y, z} and {resultX, resultY, resultZ}.
```

```lua
function create_object_label(object)
  local is_on_screen, x, y = WorldToScreen(object);
  if (is_on_screen) then
    local screen_physical_width, screen_physical_height = GetPhysicalScreenSize();

    local scale_y = 768 / (screen_physical_height * UIParent:GetEffectiveScale());
    label = CreateFrame("Frame", nil, esp_background_frame);
    label_font_string = label:CreateFontString(nil, "BORDER");
    label_font_string:SetPoint("TOPLEFT");
    label_font_string:SetJustifyH("CENTER");
    label_font_string:SetText("some words");
    label:SetWidth(label_font_string:GetStringWidth());
    label:SetHeight(label_font_string:GetStringHeight());
    label:SetPoint("BOTTOMLEFT", x * screen_physical_width * scale_x, y * screen_physical_height * scale_y);
  end
end
```

- `x, y, z[, object] = ScreenToWorld(x, y)`

Projects a screen NDC position (ranging between 0.0 to 1.0 with coord origin at the bottom-left of the window client area) to a world object or a terrain position.

This is useful to calculate a world position for the cursor position. Combined with the BLZ API "GetCursorPosition()", an example to do this is given below with UI scaling involved.

```lua
function get_cursor_world_position()
  local scale, cursor_x, cursor_y = UIParent:GetEffectiveScale(), GetCursorPosition();
  local screen_width = GetScreenWidth() * scale;
  local screen_height = GetScreenHeight() * scale;
  x, y, z = ScreenToWorld(cursor_x / screen_width, cursor_y / screen_height);
  if (x) then
      return {x, y, z};
  else
      return nil;
  end
end
```
